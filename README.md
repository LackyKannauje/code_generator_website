🧑‍🏫 How It Works
Enter your coding query: Describe your problem or desired solution.
Choose your language: Select from supported languages (C++, Java, Python, etc.).
Receive solutions:
Brute Force: A basic solution that works but may not be the most efficient.
Better: A more optimized approach.
Optimal: The most efficient and refined solution.
Explore APIs: Leverage integrated APIs for additional insights and solutions.


🎨 UI/UX
Bootstrap: The project uses Bootstrap for responsive design and an intuitive interface.
EJS Templates: Dynamic content rendering on the frontend using EJS.


🔗 API Usage
Generative API
The Generative API is responsible for generating coding solutions based on the query and selected language. It returns three different solutions with varying efficiency levels.


🌟 Future Improvements
User Authentication: Allow users to save their queries and solutions.
Code Execution: Implement a feature to run and test the generated code within the platform.
Advanced Filters: Add filters for specific algorithm types (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming).
